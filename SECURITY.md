# Security Policy for My GitHub User Profile

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in my GitHub user profile, I appreciate your help in disclosing it to me responsibly. To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Privately** share the details of the vulnerability with me by sending a direct message to my GitHub account or by emailing me at [security@example.com](mailto:contact.chaipat@gmail.com). Please refrain from posting the vulnerability publicly until I have addressed the issue.
2. Provide me with a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the steps to reproduce it and any additional information that may be helpful for my investigation.
3. Allow me sufficient time to assess and address the vulnerability. I will aim to provide a timely response and resolve any issues as quickly as possible.
4. I will acknowledge your report upon receipt and keep you informed of the progress in resolving the vulnerability.
5. Once the vulnerability is resolved, I will give you appropriate credit, unless you wish to remain anonymous.

Please note that I kindly request you to abide by responsible disclosure principles and not to exploit the vulnerability or disclose it to others until I have resolved the issue.

## Security Practices

While I strive to maintain a secure GitHub user profile, I also encourage you to follow these security best practices:

- Keep your GitHub account secure by using a strong, unique password and enabling two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Be cautious of phishing attempts and suspicious links related to your GitHub account. Always verify the authenticity of requests before providing any sensitive information.
- Regularly review the repositories and organizations you have access to and revoke access for any that are no longer needed.
- Be mindful of the personal information you share on your GitHub profile, ensuring you do not disclose sensitive data.

By following these security practices, you can help protect your GitHub account and contribute to a safer GitHub community.

## Security Updates

In case a security vulnerability is discovered and addressed in my GitHub user profile, I will provide relevant updates and information through my profile's README or by other means. It is recommended to follow or watch my GitHub profile to stay informed about any security-related announcements.
